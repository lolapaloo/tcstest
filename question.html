<ul>
	<li>Movie List should list &nbsp;&nbsp;Title,Actors and image of the Movie.</li>
	<li>The user can input both <strong>Title</strong> or any <strong>Actor</strong>&nbsp;to search for a movie.</li>
	<li>Search should be case insensitive.</li>
	<li>Movielist should render searched movies&nbsp;as user types in TextInput.</li>
	<li><strong>movie.js</strong> contains information about books.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Note :</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><b>If you get &quot;port already in use&quot; error while running the application, kill the application and re-run the rest.</b></li>
	<li>Since React-Native will be running on the browser, there are some limitations on component&nbsp;support, however, the question is designed keeping in mind those limitations.</li>
	<li>Install all dependencies before testing.</li>
	<li>To install&nbsp;dependencies, <strong>run-&gt;install.</strong></li>
	<li>to test,<strong> run-&gt;test.</strong></li>
</ul>
